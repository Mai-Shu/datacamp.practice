##Your first Numpy array
In this chapter, we're going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of Numpy, a powerful package to do data science.

A list baseball has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a Numpy array from it?
###Instructions
Import the numpy package as np, so that you can refer to numpy with np.
Use np.array() to create a Numpy array from baseball. Name this array np_baseball.
Print out the type of np_baseball to check that you got it right.

###Sloution
```
# Create list baseball 
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# Create a Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

<script.py> output:
    <class 'numpy.ndarray'>

```


##Baseball players' height
You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: height. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a Numpy array out of it and convert the units to centimeters?

height is already available and the numpy package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: stat.ucla.edu).
###Instructions
Create a Numpy array from height. Name this new array np_height.
Print np_height.
Multiply np_height with 0.0254 to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, np_height_m.
Print out np_height_m and check if the output makes sense.
###Solution
```
# height is available as a regular list

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a Numpy array from height: np_height
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out np_height
print(np_height)

# Convert np_height to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)


<script.py> output:
    [74 74 72 ..., 75 75 73]
    [ 1.8796  1.8796  1.8288 ...,  1.905   1.905   1.8542]
```
##Baseball players' BMI
The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. Again, both are available as regular Python lists: height and weight. height is in inches and weight is in pounds.

It's now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player. Python code to convert height to a Numpy array with the correct units is already available in the workspace. Follow the instructions step by step and finish the game!
###Instructions
Create a Numpy array from the weight list with the correct units. Multiply by 0.453592 to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting Numpy array as np_weight_kg.
Use np_height_m and np_weight_kg to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:
BMI=weight(kg)height(m)2
BMI=weight(kg)height(m)2
Save the resulting numpy array as bmi.
Print out bmi.
###Solution
```
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight with correct units: np_weight_kg 
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)
<script.py> output:
    [ 23.11037639  27.60406069  28.48080465 ...,  25.62295933  23.74810865
      25.72686361]
```
##Lightweight baseball players
To subset both regular Python lists and Numpy arrays, you can use square brackets:
```
x = [4 , 9 , 6, 3, 1]
x[1]
import numpy as np
y = np.array(x)
y[1]
```
For Numpy specifically, you can also use boolean Numpy arrays:
```
high = y > 5
y[high]
```
The code that calculates the BMI of all baseball players is already included. Follow the instructions and reveal interesting things from the data!
###Instructions
Create a boolean Numpy array: the element of the array should be True if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the < operator for this. Name the array light.
Print the array light.
Print out a Numpy array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use light inside square brackets to do a selection on the bmi array.
###Solution
```
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light = bmi < 21

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[bmi < 21])
<script.py> output:
    [False False False ..., False False False]
    [ 20.54255679  20.54255679  20.69282047  20.69282047  20.34343189
      20.34343189  20.69282047  20.15883472  19.4984471   20.69282047
      20.9205219 ]
```

##Numpy side effects
As Filip explained before, Numpy is great to do vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, Numpy arrays cannot contain elements with different types. If you try to build such a list, some of the elments' types are changed to end up with a homogenous list. This is known as type coercion.

Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as +, -, * and / have a different meaning for regular Python lists and Numpy arrays.

Have a look at this line of code:
```
np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])
```
Can you tell which code chunk builds the exact same Python object? The Numpy package is already imported as np, so you can start experimenting in the IPython Shell straight away!
###Solution
A np.array([True, 1, 2, 3, 4, False]) 

B np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2]) 

C np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1]) 

D np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

Ans:B
##Subsetting Numpy Arrays
You've seen it with your own eyes: Python lists and Numpy arrays sometimes behave differently. Luckily, there are still certainties in this world. For example, subsetting (using the square bracket notation on lists or arrays) works exactly the same. To see this for yourself, try the following lines of code in the IPython Shell:
```
x = ["a", "b", "c"]
x[1]

np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[1]
```
The script on the right already contains code that imports numpy as np, and stores both the height and weight of the MLB players as Numpy arrays.
###Instructions
Subset np_weight: print out the element at index 50.
Print out a sub-array of np_height: It contains the elements at index 100 up to and including index 110
###Solution
```
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight = np.array(weight)
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height[100:111])


<script.py> output:
    200
    [73 74 72 73 69 72 73 75 75 73 72]
```

np_2d[1,:]
array([65.4, 59.2, 63.6, 88.4, 68.7])
```

##Your first 2D Numpy Arrays
Before working on the actual MLB data, let's try to create a 2D Numpy array from a small list of lists.

In this exercise, baseball is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. baseball is already coded for you in the script.

###Instructions
Use np.array() to create a 2D Numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
Print out the type of np_baseball.
Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball. Use np_baseball.shape.
###Solution
```
# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))



# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)
<script.py> output:
    <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    (4, 2)

```
##Baseball data in 2D form
You have another look at the MLB data and realize that it makes more sense to restructure all this information in a 2D Numpy array. This array should have 1015 rows, corresponding to the 1015 baseball players you have information on, and 2 columns (for height and weight).

The MLB was, again, very helpful and passed you the data in a different structure, a Python list of lists. In this list of lists, each sublist represents the height and weight of a single baseball player. The name of this embedded list is baseball.

Can you store the data as a 2D array to unlock Numpy's extra functionality?

###Instructions
Use np.array() to create a 2D Numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball.
###Solution
```
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)


# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)

<script.py> output:
    (1015, 2)
```
##Subsetting 2D Numpy Arrays
If your 2D Numpy array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements "a" and "c" are extracted from a list of lists.
```
# regular list of lists
x = [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
[x[0][0], x[1][0]]

# numpy
import numpy as np
np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[:,0]
```
For regular Python lists, this is a real pain. For 2D Numpy arrays, however, it's pretty intuitive! The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The : is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.

The code that converts the pre-loaded baseball list to a 2D Numpy array is already in the script. Add some lines to make the correct selections. Remember that in Python, the first element is at index 0!
###Instructions
Print out the 50th row of np_baseball.
Make a new variable, np_weight, containing the entire second column of np_baseball.
Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in np_baseball and print it out.
###Solution
```
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])


# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight
np_weight = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])
<script.py> output:
    [ 70 195]
    210

<script.py> output:
    [ 70 195]
    75
```
